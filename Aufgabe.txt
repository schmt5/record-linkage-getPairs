Dear Professor Sariyar:
I am using your great tools to do matching. I got a quick question:
In getPairs (matches or links), we have
filter.match = c("match", "unknown", "nonmatch"),
filter.link = c("nonlink", "possible", "link"),
do we have any ways to calculate their confidence levels related?
Thanks and best regards,
